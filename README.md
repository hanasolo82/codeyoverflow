# CodeyOverflow Forum
In this project, we will build the beginnings of a web forum! A forum is an online discussion board where users can exchange their opinions on a variety of topics. The most important component of a forum is the comment section. This is what we’ll work on in this project.

In building this application, you will sharpen your skills in React components by practicing using props as well as defining, rendering, and referencing components.
